This R script demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to predict whether a person is likely to fully repay a loan, based on features from a dataset called `loan_data`. After an initial exploration with `str()` and `summary()`, categorical variables are converted into factors for better model handling. The dataset is visualized using `ggplot2` to examine distributions and relationships between variables, including how *FICO scores* and *interest rates* correlate with the likelihood of repayment (encoded in the `not.fully.paid` variable). 

The data is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using the `caTools` package. An SVM model is then trained on the training data using the `e1071` package, with `not.fully.paid` as the target variable. The model is evaluated on the test set, and its predictions are compared against actual outcomes using a confusion matrix. Hyperparameter tuning is performed with the `tune()` function to identify the optimal `cost` and `gamma` parameters for the radial kernel. The final model is retrained with these tuned parameters to improve prediction accuracy. This project highlights the application of SVMs for identifying high-risk borrowers, which is a critical task for financial institutions in minimizing default risks.
